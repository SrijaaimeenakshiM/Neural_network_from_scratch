# Neural Network Forward and Backward Pass from Scratch

This project demonstrates the **forward and backward pass of a neural network built entirely from scratch using Python**. It does not rely on any external machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The project is inspired by educational content from *Neural Networks from Scratch* (NNFS).

---

## 📚 Features
- Complete **manual implementation** of forward pass.
- Manual **backpropagation** to update weights.
- Visualizes the process using the `spiral_data` dataset from the `nnfs` library.
- Step-by-step understanding of how a neural network learns.

---

## 📂 Files Included
- `neural_network_forward_backward_from_scratch.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire implementation.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
You need the following Python packages:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `nnfs`

Install them using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib nnfs

## 🚀 How to Run

📥 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SrijaaimeenakshiM/Neural_network_from_scratch.git
▶️ Run the Notebook

Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd Neural_network_from_scratch
